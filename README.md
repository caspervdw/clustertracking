===============
An algorithm to track overlapping features in video images

[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/caspervdw/clustertracking.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caspervdw/clustertracking)

This package contains Python code for tracking overlapping features in video images,
such as present in for example confocal images of colloidal clusters. The code
is heavily based on [Trackpy](http://github.com/soft-matter/trackpy).

Dependencies
------------
- numpy
- scipy
- pandas
- trackpy
- pims

This package was developed in by Casper van der Wel, as part of his
PhD thesis work in Daniela Kraft's group at the Huygens-Kamerlingh-Onnes laboratory,
Institute of Physics, Leiden University, The Netherlands. This work was
supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO/OCW).
